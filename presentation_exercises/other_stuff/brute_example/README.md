#Important
This is not a bug, but sometimes it is useful to have a bruteforce tool or a fuzzy tool to analyse some programs.

#Bruteforce Attack
In this example you can have fun in finding a password with a simple bruteforce attack.

1. Compile the application:
gcc -o pass pass.c

2. Test the application by trying some inputs
3. Copy the brute.c file
cp brute.c myName_brute.c

4. Modify the myName_brute.c
5. Compile the myName_brute.c
gcc -o myName_brute myName_brute.c

6. Test your bruteforce attack program.
